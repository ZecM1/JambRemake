# JAVASCRIPT Project - Jamb Remake

## NOTE

This project was created to showcase how much I learned and advanced in the span of 4 months. I redid the entire Jamb project and even improved it further!

## Description

Jamb is a game of dice and strategy, an engaging and interactive game also known as 5Dice or Yahtzee. Jamb offers a unique blend of strategy and luck.
This project showcases a significant amount of JavaScript and CSS, utilized to create dynamic animations and enhance user interaction.
The development of Jamb required careful consideration of game logic to ensure the score calculations and inputs work perfectly.

### Key changes from the previous version:

- **Simplified Code:** The remake features shorter and simpler code, making it easier to maintain and understand.
- **Modular JavaScript:** Instead of a single large JavaScript file, the remake uses modules to organize code, improving code readability and maintainability.
- **CSS Variables:** Replaces SCSS with CSS variables for styling and animations, simplifying the styling process and making the codebase more accessible.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Implements dark/light mode to suithe the player styling preferences.
- **Player Selection and Name Change:** Allows players to choose from 1 to 4 players and rename them.
  The code includes placeholders and guidelines for further expansion, allowing you to increase the number further at the risk of breaking the styling.

However, it's important to note that the use of modules requires the site to be run on a live server to function properly.

## Key Features and Technologies Used in the Development

### JavaScript for Game Logic and Interaction:

Implements complex game logic, including dice rolls, placeholder inputs, player turn changes, score calculations, name change, new game starting and theme changing showcasing a deep understanding of JavaScript.

### CSS animations and styling:

Utilizes CSS for creating smooth and visually appealing animations and styling, enhancing the user experience and making the game more engaging.

### Game Logic Development:

The project served as a showcase of my current Javascript knowledge and learning progress, with the game logic being a significant challenge that helped in deepening the understanding of the language.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Open the `index.html` file in Visual Studio Code
- Install "Live Server" extension
- Click on the "Go Live" button in the bottom left

## Increasing the number of players

To increase the number of players you need to make two simple edits:

- In `index.html` find the comment that says "INSERT MORE PLAYERS HERE"
- Uncomment for each player you want to add into the game(MUST BE SAME AS JS FILE)
- In `script.js` find the comment that says "INSERT MORE PLAYERS HERE"
- Uncomment for each player you want to add into the game (MUST BE SAME AS HTML FILE)

If you wish to increase the number further, just follow the logic that the comments used, there is no limit to it.
